== Description ==

= IMPORTANT NOTE TO ANYBODY CONSIDERING ADDING THIS PLUGIN TO A WP-MU INSTALLATION: =

If you aren't sure whether you are using a WP-MU blog, then you aren't. Trust me. If this warning applies to you, then you will know it.

For WP-MU administrators: You should not use this plugin. Your users could use it to place (potentially malicious) javascript into their blogs.

This plugin is PERFECTLY SAFE for non-WP-MU blogs, so ignore this message if you're using regular wordpress (you probably are).

= Considerations =

* URLs should be valid (i.e. begin with http://)
* The same URL can appear on more than one line (i.e. with more than one keyword).
* Because a word can only link to one site, a keyword should not appear on more than one line. If it does, only the last instance of the keyword will be matched to its URL.
* If one of your keywords is a substring of the other--e.g. "download wordpress" and "wordpress"--then you should list the shorter one later than the first one.
* Keywords are case-insensitive (e.g. "wordpress" is the same as "WoRdPrEsS").
* Spaces count, so "wordpress" is not the same as "wordpress ".
* Keywords will be linked only if they occur in your post as a word (or phrase), not as a partial word. So if one of your keywords is "a" (for some strange reason), it will be linked only when it occurs as the word "a"--when the letter "a" occurs within a word, it will not be linked.
* You can use any valid target attribute, not just "_blank"--see <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">W3C</a> for a list of valid targets.


= DATABASE STRUCTURE =

The options->alink_tap_linker_remote page will create a set of matching terms and URLs that gets stored as a list.

"alink_tap_linker_remote" is a serialized value as follows:

  array(
    'keyword1' => array(
        'name' => the keyword
        'url' => the original url
        'urles' => the url that serve the content in spanish
        'licencia' => 1, 0  if 1, we check if client's ip is from Spain and use the urles as link
    ),
    'keyword2' => array(
        'name' => the keyword
        'url' => the original url
        'urles' => the url that serve the content in spanish
        'licencia' => 1, 0  if 1, we check if client's ip is from Spain and use the urles as link
    ),
  )

== Updates ==

The basic structure of this plugin was cloned from the [WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate](https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) project.
This plugin supports the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin, so if you install that, this plugin becomes automatically updateable direct from GitHub. Any submission to WP.org repo will make this redundant.
